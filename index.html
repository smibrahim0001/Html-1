	HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages.It is the most basic building block required for brdeveloping websites.HTML is used for creating the foundation for your page.

It is a collection of plugins and extensions that make it faster and easier to use JS on your website. jQuery takes common tasks that require multiple lines of JS code and compresses them into a format that can be executed with a single line.A jq program is a “filter”: it takes an input, and produces an output. There are a lot of builtin filters for extracting a particular field of an object, or converting a number to a string, or various other standard tasks.

	Filters can be combined in various ways - you can pipe the output of one filter into another filter, or collect the output of a filter into an array.

	Some filters produce multiple results, for instance there’s one that produces all the elements of its input array. Piping that filter into a second runs the second filter for each element of the array. Generally, things that would be done with loops and iteration in other languages are just done by gluing filters together in
